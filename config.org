#+TITLE: Atri Hegde's Emacs config
#+AUTHOR: Atri Hegde

I am messing around with Emacs for now. Waiting for Emacs 29 to come out before I try to build my config from scratch

* Package management
** Setup package.el to work with MELPA
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

** Install use-package
